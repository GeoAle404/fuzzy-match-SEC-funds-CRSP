# fuzzy-match-SEC-funds-CRSP
This repository contains Python code to fuzzy match SEC mutual funds with CRSP fund names. You may use the code to replicate our paper (Alekseev et al., 2022) or in your own projects. While the approach and methodology are all coauthors' joint work, the code is solely written by me. If you use the code, please cite the paper.
